<li style="color:Green;"> Answering Paragraph; </li>
  <p> In terms of a place to post answers on a topic, I think the most appropriate location to post these things would be
on 000webhost (c), just because it has the best formatting for a kind of "topic hud". I personally think vdrive, and the other options we
would have to host the topics on are less user-friendly and don't look as appealing to read from. When you're hosting on more of a 
visually appealing site it makes topics seem more conceptually easy to understand and accept. This is my opinion on the topic.<p>
