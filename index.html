I was unable to edit your page to edit my topics page, saying "Invalid Permissions". So i posted a link to my own wordpress page.

Link(s) 3; https://webp.svsu.edu/~tekeit/prog01.html/ - VDRIVE

Answering Paragraph: In terms of a place to post answers on a topic, I think the most appropriate location to post these things would be
on 000webhost (c), just because it has the best formatting for a kind of "topic hud". I personally think vdrive, and the other options we
would have to host the topics on are less user-friendly and don't look as appealing to read from. When you're hosting on more of a 
visually appealing site it makes topics seem more conceptually easy to understand and accept. This is my opinion on the topic.
